# Preface

To end the reign of terror of ants and bees within the universum of heuristics, we introduce BumbleBO.

# BumbleBO

BumbleBO is a framework for Bayesian Optimization that supports almost all regressor models from sklearn, i.e. about 50 different models, as surrogate models.
The acquisiton function is optimized using multi-objective heuristics from [pymoo](https://pymoo.org/) and 
resampling-based uncertainty measures (todo!).
