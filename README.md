# Preface

To end the reign of terror of ants and bees within the universum of heuristics, we introduce BumbleBO.

# BumbleBO

BumbleBO is a framework for Bayesian Optimization that supports (almost) all regressor models from sklearn (about 50) as surrogate models.
The acquisiton function is optimized using multi-objective heuristics from [pymoo](https://pymoo.org/) and 
resampling-based uncertainty measures.
