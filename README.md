# Preface

To end the reign of terror of ants and bees within the universum of heuristics, we introduce BumbleBO.

# BumbleBO

BumbleBO is a framework for Bayesian Optimization with arbitrary surrogate models (e.g. all learners from sklearn). The acquisiton function is optimized using multi-objective heuristics from [pymoo](https://pymoo.org/) and resampling-based uncertainty measures.
